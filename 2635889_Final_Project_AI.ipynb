    "### Introduction to the Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "The object I have chosen is GB 247 MS Gen 1, the Journal of a Continental Tour. It is a remarkable piece of history that lies in the heart of the Archives and Special Collections. This journal documents a continental tour from 1867 to 1868, as it offers a unique glimpse into the experiences, observations, and visual expressions of its author during a period of considerable social and cultural change.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the 18th of November, 1953, it was brought to the collection by John Smith. Comprising pen and ink drawings alongside photographs, this manuscript not only narrates a journey across continents but also encapsulates a moment in time where the confluence of art, travel, and observation painted a vivid picture of the world as seen through the eyes of its author.\n"

    "### Objectives of Our Digital Odyssey\n",
    "In an era where individuals are drawn to immediate gratification offered by YouTube videos, TikToks, and Instagram Reels over the practice of reading books and journals, I am taking the opportunity to breathe new life into this historic journal. Over the last few years, research indicates that today's generation is more likely to engage with content in brief, digestible segments, typically not extending beyond a few minutes on social media platforms [(Chakraborty, 2024)](https://www.winsavvy.com/engaging-millennials-and-gen-z/)\n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    "In response to this transformative landscape, I will use the journal as a springboard to explore and question existing technical, social, and cultural topics relevant to the time of its creation and our current era. To achieve this, I will present the journal's rich contents in a format that resonates with the prevailing media consumption habits - YouTube short/reel/TikTok. The outcome is a video that draws the viewers' attention by showing beautiful screens from all the places the author visited, beautifully edited. This will make the viewer read the description which will be the story highlighting the most important parts and events of the journey. This digital odyssey facilitates the bridge between the past and present by fostering a reflective exploration of travelling and the discovery of new cultures in the past.\n",

    "### Engaging With the Journal: A New Perspective\n",
    "Firstly, I will use the power of AI, particularly the capabilities of ChatGPT, to analyse and summarise the journal's transcript by Robert McLean. In this way, the essence of the narrative will be distilled. Hence, the results should be a modern interpretation that makes the journal's content will be quicker to engage with and provides a fresh lens through which to view historical accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, the hand-written text in the journal is accompanied by black-and-white hand-drawn illustrations. I am going to use these and the summarised text of the transcript as a basis for generating vibrant, digital illustrations. With Midjourney, I will transform these historical visual elements into colourful digital artworks. Lastly, based on the newly generated images and the summarised text, new prompts will be designed that bring these images to life - animating them and turning them into ai-generated videos. This is how the past can be reimagined with the vibrancy and dynamism of the present - turned into an educational social media post with video content and a description that will make people willing to engage with this journey on a new level.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is more, Python code from open-source packages will play a crucial role in this transformation, facilitating the creation of these digital illustrations and enabling the integration of these visuals with AI-generated content. This technical synergy will help me to produce rich, engaging content, offering viewers a dynamic and immersive exploration of the journal's journey.\n",

This transcript is filled with detailed observations, personal reflections, and vivid descriptions of the places and people from the journal. Because of the great potential of AI to tell the narrative that is hidden within these pages in a more systematised way, I turned to ChatGPT. I will, first, upload the transcript to the AI tool, to distil the essence that retains the narrative's soul while making it accessible to a modern audience that is used to find information in shorter passages of text.\n",

After a series of tries, I built a prompt and sent it to the ChatGPT 4.0 chatbot.\n",

It is based on a large language model - OpenAI's proprietary Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models, specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for its different versions. These are good for conversational purposes thanks to a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this way, people improve how the model performs by ranking responses in conversations to fine-tune the model.\n",
